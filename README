These options are ignored when a KEY is given, as these settings are encoded by the KEY:

	          (subtraction problems give non-negative answers by defalut)
	-d RxC    Specify the number of Rows and Columns of problems on the worksheet
	          (maximum value for each is 16)
	-o [+-x/] Choose the operations to perform
	          (+ and - are enabled by default)
	-r L:H    Specify the range of numbers to quiz
